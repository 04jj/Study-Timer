# Study-Timer
Study timer with a long and short break. Tracks how many short study sessions you've completed with checkmarks as well.

If you want to modify the length of the breaks/study session you can change the variables WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, and/or LONG_BREAK_MIN.
You can also modify the colors using hex code or change the background image (as long as you change the "cupcakie.png" in line 70 to the name of the new image you wish to use).
